# README
This is the initial rails app that I am building as part of the Lynda course "Ruby on Rails 5 Essential Training"
I am hoping to get a better understanding of how to utilize GitHub and similar development services.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
